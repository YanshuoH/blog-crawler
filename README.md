# blog-crawler
Yet another crawler for my blogs. Saved for further analyze usage.

This is a home made script for personal usage with quite a few error handling.

## run
```
node src/index.js --sites sina --sites sohu --sites renren -n 500
```

* `-n` equals to `--number` which limites blog count. Often set to 1 for test purpose.
